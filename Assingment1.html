	<h2>Re: Eileen Dover universsity application</h2>
	<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
	<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University 
	of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>of your PhD next year.
		I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
	<h3>Starting dates</h3>
	<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time,
	however it would suit us better if you<br>could start at the beginning
	of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
		<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
		<li>Third semesster: 2 May 2017</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you 
	would prefer.</p>
	<p>You can find more information about <a href="http//:www.google.com">
	important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
	<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
	<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded
	research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>somewhere in the
	realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated
	researcher, and just<br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
	Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>by are
	as follows, in order of priority:
	<ol>
		<li>Turning <b>H</b><sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
		Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub><b>H</b><sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
		<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at
		temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F),when the<br>
		audience size exponentially increaes(effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>
		increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
		<li><u><b>HTML</b></u> and <u><b>CSS</b></u> constructs for representing musical
		scores.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>So pleasse can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
	including how long you'd expect the<br>research to take, required staff
	and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
	<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
	<p>Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic
	tribal dances. To answer your question,<br> my favourite dances are as follows,
	with definitions:</p>
	<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
		<ul>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as
		<b>300BC</b>, a whole village would dance around<br>in a circle like chickens, to
		encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</ul>
	<p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
		<ul>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
		used to practise this dance, which<br>involved huddling close together in
		a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
		<br>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
		he thought this dance inspired<br>modern styles such as Twerking.</ul>
	<p>Artic robot dance</p>
		<ul>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in 
		the 1960s believed to have<br>discovered a new dance style characterised by 
		"robotic", stilted movements, being practised by inhabitants<br>of Northern
		Alaska and Canada. Later on howeveer it was discovered that they were just
		moving like this<br>because they were really cold.</ul>
	<p>For more of my research, see my

	<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
